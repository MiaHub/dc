### About coding
test
Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.

A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.

In the fast changing world of ever new technology you can get overwhelmed by information.
That is why it is important to be well organized and structured. 
Luckily there is no need to remember every little detail of a manual. 
You just need to remember where you can look up those details.
This is what this website is about.
