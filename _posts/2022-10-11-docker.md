### About Docker
Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

Containers simplify development and delivery of distributed applications. They have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments. It’s possible for developers to create containers without Docker, by working directly with capabilities built into Linux and other operating systems. But Docker makes containerization faster, easier and safer. At this writing, Docker reported over 13 million developers using the platform (link resides outside ibm.com).

Docker also refers to Docker, Inc. (link resides outside ibm.com), the company that sells the commercial version of Docker, and to the Docker open source project to which Docker, Inc, and many other organizations and individuals contribute.
