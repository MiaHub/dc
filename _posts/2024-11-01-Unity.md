Create a language learning program using unity.

Project Base:
Shooting on Words
3d

Problem to solve:
Game Mechanics
- Show prhase of most common phrase / word pool
- Let words from this phrase appear in the room
- Shoot on the word of the prhase
-
Can you just show all whole words ?
- The longest word among more common words in english / spain is about 25characters
- So you could just limit the word pool to words under 25 chars
Word-Pool
- What Language can you learn ? It would probably be best if we start with motherlanguage = english and wanted language = english aswell
  Later we can translate the motherlanguage to all other languages using a translator maybe
  And the wanted language we can adjust either with a translator aswell,
  or add one pool after another making it higher quality
  since other languages might have other word priority and so on.
