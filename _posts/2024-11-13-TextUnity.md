You can use TextMeshPro to create Text dynamically in Unity but there is no real 3d effect.
Meaning you cannot create depth using TextMehPro.

There are some assets in the AssetStore though. 
VText which is free. I didnt see how can create Text using script though. 

And Dynamic 3D Text which costs 130â‚¬ atm.
